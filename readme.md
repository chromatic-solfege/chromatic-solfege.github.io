Chromatic Solfege
==================

Chromatic Solfege is a variant of Solfege. While Solfege is base on a diatonic
scale, Chromatic Solfege is based on the twelve-note chromatic scale. This is
great for improving your skill of improvisation especially in Jazz.

I have written some programs to utilize Chromatic-Solfege.

- [aaron.ly](./chromatic-solfege-for-lilypond/) a Lilypond library to write
  music with Chromatic-Solfege.

- [Chromatic Solfege for JavaScript](./chromatic-solfege/)  

- [Chromadoc](./chromadoc/) A documentation tool to create documents which
  consist tex documents with musical notations which are written in
  Chromatic-Solfege.  This includes a program which converts your documents
  into tex documents. It also automatically converts your documents into audio
  data with singing the note names.

- [An Introduction to Chromatic-Solfege](an-introduction-to-chromatic-solfege/)
  a paper describing about Chromatic-Solfege. What I have done here is :
    -  I have reorganized a Chromatic Solfege's note name system into a new
       system which I believe suitable for improving your ability of
       improvising, notably redefined note names with double, triple and
       quadruple accidentals, which are important for contemporary jazz, and
       written a paper about the definition of the new note names.

    - A number of practice patterns to build fluency with the note names.

    - A videos of a computer generated singing which reads aloud the note
      names.

- The source code of the [An Introduction to
  Chromatic-Solfege](an-introduction-to-chromatic-solfege/). The paper itself
  is written by Chromadoc.
