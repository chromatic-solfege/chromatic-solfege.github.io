Chromatic Solfege
==================

Chromatic Solfege is a variant of Solfege. Solfege's note name system is base on
a diatonic scale; therefore there are some difficulties to read songs which are
polymodal by the traditional Solfege. Chromatic Solfege is based on the
twelve-note chromatic scale and it is suitable to read such songs.

In Chromatic Solfege, there are two scales :

Augumented ( Ascent )
    do di re ri mi fa fi sol si la li ti do

Diminished ( Descent )
    do ti te la le sol se fa mi me re ra do


What I offer here is :

- Extended and reorganized the note name system to read some notes which are
  with irregular tonals.

- I have written some documentation tools to write documents with Chromatic Solfege.
