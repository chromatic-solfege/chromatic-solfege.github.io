Chromatic Solfege

Chromatic Solfege is a variant of Solfege. While Solfege is base on a diatonic
scale, Chromatic Solfege is based on the twelve-note chromatic scale. This is
great for improving your skill of improvisation especially in Jazz.

What I have done here is :

-  I have reorganized a Chromatic Solfege's note name system into a new system
   which I believe suitable for improving your ability of improvising, notably
   redefined note names with double, triple and quadruple accidentals, which
   are important for contemporary jazz, and written a paper about the
   definition of the new note names.

-  I have written some applications to write the documentation. It allows you
   to write documents which consists the note names of Chromatic-Solfege.
