Chromatic Solfege
==================

Chromatic Solfege is a variant of Solfege. Solfege's note name system is base on
a diatonic scale; therefore, by the traditional Solfege, there are some
difficulties to read songs which are polymodal . Chromatic Solfege is based on
the twelve-note chromatic scale and it is suitable to read such songs.

In Chromatic Solfege, there are two scales :

#### Augumented ( Ascent )

> _do di re ri mi fa fi sol si la li ti do_

#### Diminished ( Descent )

> _do ti te la le sol se fa mi me re ra do_


What I have done here is :

- I have extended the note name system for reading notes which are with
  irregular tonals, and reorganized it into a new system, and then written a
  description about the system; this is what I call Chromatic-Solfege.

- I have written some helper tool applications to write documentation with
  Chromatic-Solfege.


What I offer here is :

- An Introduction to Chromatic-Solfege

- [aaron.ly](./chromadoc/) A Lilypond library to input notes by 
  Chromatic-Solfege.

- [chromadoc](./chromadoc/lib-ly/aaron.md)
  A documentation tool to create documents which consist tex documents with
  musical notations.
