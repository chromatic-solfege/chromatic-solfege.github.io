Chromatic Solfege
==================

Chromatic Solfege is a variant of Solfege. While Solfege is base on a diatonic
scale, Chromatic Solfege is based on the twelve-note chromatic scale. This is
great for improving your skill of improvisation especially in Jazz.

What I have done here is :

- I have reorganized a Chromatic Solfege's note name system into a new system
  which I believe suitable for acquiring better understanding of tonality in
  irregular keys/scales by defining double, triple and quadruple accidentals,
  and then written a paper about the definition of the new note names.

- I have written some applications to write documentation with
  Chromatic-Solfege.

What I offer here is :

- (An Introduction to Chromatic-Solfege)[an-introduction-to-chromatic-solfege/]
  The description about Chromatic-Solfege which I reorganized.
  
- I also presented a number of practice patterns to build fluency with the note
  names.

- Videos to intuitively learn the Chromatic-Solfege.

- [aaron.ly](./chromadoc/lib-ly/aaron) A Lilypond library to write music with
  Chromatic-Solfege.

- [chromadoc](chromadoc) This allows your documents to sing. A documentation
  tool to create documents which consist tex documents with musical notations.
  This includes a program which converts your documents into tex documents. It
  also automatically converts your documents into audio/video data.
