Chromatic-Solfege is a variant of Solfege.  While Solfege is base on a diatonic 
scale, Chromatic-Solfege is based on the twelve-note chromatic scale. This is 
great for improving your skill of improvisation especially in Jazz.

## Utilities for Chromatic-Solfege
I have written some programs to utilize Chromatic-Solfege.

- [Chromatic-Solfege for Lilypond](./chromatic-solfege-for-lilypond/)
  a Lilypond library to write music with Chromatic-Solfege. This library 
  includes some utilities to manipulate intervals and notes which are written 
  in Chromatic-Solfege.

- [Chromatic-Solfege for JavaScript](./chromatic-solfege-for-javascript/) 
  JavaScript module to manipulate notes and intervals which are written in 
  Chromatic-Solfege. This module also includes the definition of all note names 
  and intervals.

- [Chromadoc](./chromadoc/) A toolkit for writing documentations includes both
  Chromatic-Solfege notation and TeX command. Chromadoc automatically generates 
  tex, synthesis singing audio and videos. 

## An Introduction to Chromatic-Solfege

I have extended the note naming rule of Chromatic-Solfege into a new form which 
I believe is more suitable to improve your ability of improvising. The 
extension covers modifying the naming rule for double, triple and quadruple 
accidentals. Those irregular accidentals are useful to analyzing pieces of 
polymodal music. And I have developed comprehensive exercises to build fluency 
for the note names. The exercises can be learned with model videos.   

I have written a paper [An Introduction to 
Chromatic-Solfege](an-introduction-to-chromatic-solfege/)
  to describe my version of Chromatic-Solfege. 
  
I described : 
-  The difference between my version of Chromatic-Solfege and others.  I have 
   extended the note naming rule of Chromatic-Solfege into a new form which I 
   believe is more suitable to improve your ability of improvising.  The 
   extension covers modifying the naming rule for double, triple and quadruple 
   accidentals. Those irregular accidentals are useful to analyzing pieces of 
   polymodal music. 

- A number of practice patterns to build fluency with the extended note
  naming rule.
- A videos of a computer generated singing which reads aloud the practice
  patterns with the Chromatic-Solfege.
