Chromatic Solfege
==================

Chromatic Solfege is a variant of Solfege. While Solfege is base on a diatonic
scale, Chromatic Solfege is based on the twelve-note chromatic scale.

In Chromatic Solfege, there are two scales as :

#### The Augmented Chromatic Scale ( Ascending ) ![do di re ri mi fa fi sol si la li ti do](an-introduction-to-chromatic-solfege/doc/solfege-aug.png)

#### The Diminished Chromatic Scale ( Descending ) ![do ti te la le sol se fa mi me re ra do](an-introduction-to-chromatic-solfege/doc/solfege-dim.png)

What I have done here is :

- I have reorganized a Chromatic Solfege's note name system into a new system
  which I believe suitable for reading music in irregular keys/scales with
  double, triple accidentals, and written a description about the system.

- I have written a number of applications to write documentation with
  Chromatic-Solfege.

What I offer here is :

- (An Introduction to Chromatic-Solfege)[an-introduction-to-chromatic-solfege]
  The description about Chromatic-Solfege which I reorganized.
  
- I also presented a number of practice patterns to build fluency with the note
  names.

- Videos to build fluency with Chromatic-Solfege.

- [aaron.ly](chromadoc/lib-ly/aaron) A Lilypond library to write music with
  Chromatic-Solfege.

- [chromadoc](chromadoc) This allows your documents sing. A documentation tool
  to create documents which consist tex documents with musical notations. This
  includes a program which converts your documents into tex documents. It also
  automatically converts your documents into audio/video data.
